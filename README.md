# VCL Documentation Client

This is an HTML viewer for the docs based on a JSON structure
such as generated by [vcl/doc-gen](https://github.com/vcl/doc-gen).
The doc fragments are included using shadow DOM.

While it has been created for the VCL it is mostly agnostic
and can be used to browse any structured documentation.

## Demo

[VCL Documentation](https://vcl.github.io).

## Usage

Use [vcl/doc-gen](https://github.com/vcl/doc-gen) to generate the input for
this client.
Or generate the `documentation.json` yourself.

**Example**

```JavaScript
// var doc = {...};
var vclDocClient = require('vcl-doc-client');

vclDocClient.getBuild(doc, function(html) {
  console.log(html);
});

```

In order to inject custom CSS or JS before the `</body>` tag,
`doc.customHTML` can be set accordingly.
